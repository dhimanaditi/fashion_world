                    <p>What began as a small surf shack in Ocean City, Maryland in the summer of 1968 has since evolved into an upscale casual shopping destination. Today, we have 25 locations (and counting) plus an online boutique. We are most loved for an ever-evolving assortment that allows our customer to discover something new with every visit; combined with our friendly yet high service environment which reflects the laidback mindset instilled in the founding store over 45 years ago.

                        <br>Inspired by our heritage at the beach and the lifestyle of our customer, our selection is versatile, innately wearable and treasured. We strive to surprise and delight by providing fresh and unique pieces from established brands and emerging designers. We’ve built our company by building relationships with warmth and kindness and just like our brand, you’ll never outgrow it. It is our unfailing mission to connect & engage with our community to inspire moments of happiness.</p>

                    <p>Fashion is a form of self-expression and autonomy at a particular period and place and in a specific context, of clothing, footwear, lifestyle, accessories, makeup, hairstyle, and body posture. The term implies a look defined by the fashion industry as that which is trending. Everything that is considered fashion is available and popularized by the fashion system (industry and media).

                       <br> Due to increased mass-production of commodities and clothing at lower prices and global reach, sustainability has become an urgent issue among politicians, brands, and consumers.</p>
